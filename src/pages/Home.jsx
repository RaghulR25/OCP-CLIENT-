          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Counseling is a professional process that provides individuals with a safe, confidential, 
            and supportive space to explore their thoughts, emotions, and challenges. It helps people 
            better understand themselves, develop healthier coping strategies, and make informed decisions 
            in their personal and professional lives. 
            <br /><br />
            A counselor acts as a guide, offering empathy, active listening, and evidence-based techniques 
            to help clients overcome difficulties and achieve personal growth. Counseling can address a wide 
            range of areas, including mental health, relationship issues, career guidance, stress management, 
            and self-improvement.
            <br /><br />
            Whether someone is experiencing emotional struggles, seeking clarity in their career path, 
            or aiming to strengthen their relationships, counseling provides the tools and support to 
            navigate lifeâ€™s challenges more effectively.
            <br /> <br />
            Counseling is a professional and supportive process that helps individuals explore their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors in a safe environment.
             It provides guidance for people facing personal, emotional, social, or psychological challenges. Through counseling, individuals can gain clarity,
              develop coping strategies, and make informed decisions about their lives.
              <br /> <br />
               It is not only about solving problems but also about fostering personal growth, self-awareness, and resilience. Counselors listen without judgment, offer insights, and encourage clients to express themselves freely, which can significantly improve mental health and overall well-being.
                Whether dealing with stress, anxiety, career dilemmas, or relationship issues, counseling acts as a valuable tool for understanding oneself better and achieving a balanced life.
